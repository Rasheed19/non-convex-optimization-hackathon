# non-convex-optimization-hackathon
This repository contains the codes for all the experiments perofrmed during the _Generative Modelling Hackathon Workshop_ under _Challenge 4: Implementing non-convex
optimization algorithms_.

# Problem statement
Given limited resources (time, training epochs, model parameters), how do different optimization algorithms behave on the task of classifying the Food101 dataset, and in the presence of mislabelled/noisy training data?

# Goal 
To experiment with different optimization algorithms and validate their performance on classifying 101 foods correctly to have the highest possible accuracy.
